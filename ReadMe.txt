SPACE INVADERS
- Use copy if newer and relative pathing
- Put a readme in with some screenshots -- bonus points for using something like screentogif
- Spellcheck your work. It's real bad.
- HandleCollisions -- If you're mixing ifs and for loops, you can probably divide it into Enumerable steps which you chain. 
- Some of your naming could use work, e.g., removeRedundentshots


STRUCTURAL CHANGES
- You can look at dependency injection to separate classes out while still having access to what you need.
- Look at GameObject pattern
- Create objects which encapsulte their behaviour. Separate your flow control "What to do" methods from your "How to do it" methods
